						<h2>Render Tag</h2>
					</div>
					<p>The render tag offers object level access to some settings of the renderer. It allows for example to turn off shadow casting for certain object. Since sometimes the shadow of some objects isn't even visible on the rendered image. So the main purpose of this tag is to decrease rendering time. </p>
					<p><i>Attention: You can only add a render tag to polygon objects. Since these are the only objects which are actually visible in the renderer.<b> </b></i></p>
					<p><b>Properties</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><i><b>Cast shadows:</b></i> Defines if an objects casts a shadow or not. 
						<li><b><i>Receive shadow: </i></b>Defines if an object receives shadows.
						<li><b><i>Visible in Radiosity: </i></b>Use this property to remove an object from the radiosity solver. For example windows (transparent materials). So light can pass through the window in the radiosity solution.
						<li><i><b>Receive Radiosity: </b></i>If you are rendering a object with a glassy material it doesn't makes sense to calculate the radiosity solution on that surface because glass doesn't have a diffuse material component. So radiosity doesn't have any effect on the appearance of glass. To reduce rendering time you can turn off the calculation of the radiosity solution on certain objects.

						<li><b><i>Receive Caustics: </i></b>Disable this property if you don't want to see caustics on that object.
						<li><b><i>Visible for primary rays:</i></b> If you turn off that property the object will become invisible in the rendered image. But it will still cast shadows.						
						<li><b><i>Filter texture:</i></b> Disable that property if you want to disable texture filtering on that object. 
					</ul>
					<ul>
