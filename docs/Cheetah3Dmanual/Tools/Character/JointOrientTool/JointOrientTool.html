It is often desirable that one axis of the local rotation axes is pointing along a bone and that a second axis is pointing sideways to the bones (see second image). If the local axis are oriented that way it is easier to perform forward kinematics. But it is also easier to set joint constraints. Last but not least do oriented joints interpolate better in the F-Curve editor since it is often sufficient that such one component of the rotation vector is animated. Unluckily the local axes of the joints are usually not oriented but for this case Cheetah3D offers the orient joints tool.</p>					<p></p>					<p>The orient joint tool can be applied in to modes:</p>					<p></p>					<ul>						<li><b>Without Second Axis</b>: If the <i>Second axis</i> property of the orient joint tool is set to None the new orientation is solely determined by the <i>Orientation</i> property and the two bones between which the joint is. The <i>Orientation</i>  specifies in which directions the local rotation axes point. Hereby  the first axis always point along the bone leaving the joint. The third axis is pointing sideways to the two bones and the second axis is perpendicular to the first and the second axis. <br>							<br>							For example if you chose a YXZ orientation. Then the first axis is the Y (<b><font color="#cc3333">Y</font></b>XZ). It will point along the bone. The third axis is the Z (YX<b><font color="#cc3333">Z</font></b>) which points sideways to the bones. Finally the second axis the  X (Y<b><font color="#cc3333">X</font></b>Z) which is perpendicular to the first (Y) and the third (Z) axis.<br>							<br>						<li><b>With Second Axis</b>: If the <i>Second axis</i> property is anything else then <i>None</i> then local rotation axes are orientated slightly different. In this case the first axis still points along the bone. But the second axis points along the axis chosen  with the <i>Second axis</i> property and the third axis is perpendicular to the first and the second axis.					</ul>					<p></p>					<div align="center">						<p><img src="JointOrient1.jpg" alt="" height="441" width="310" border="0"> <img src="JointOrient2.jpg" alt="" height="441" width="310" border="0"></p>						<p>On the left image you can see two bones with unoriented joint. After applying a XYZ orient with no second axis<br>							the X-Axis is pointing along the bone and the Z axis is pointing sideways two the two bones.</p>					</div>					<p></p>					<p><b><i>Modes<br>							</i></b>This tool works in all modes equally.</p>					<ul>						<li><img src="../../../Images/Pointmode.jpg" alt="" height="32" width="32" border="0"><img src="../../../Images/Edgemode.jpg" alt="" height="32" width="32" border="0"><img src="../../../Images/Polygonmode.jpg" alt="" height="32" width="32" border="0"><img src="../../../Images/Objectmode.jpg" alt="" height="32" width="32" border="0"><br>To use the  orient joint tool just select &quot;Tools<img src="../../../Images/arrow.gif" alt="" width="10" height="10" border="0">Character<img src="../../../Images/arrow.gif" alt="" width="10" height="10" border="0">Orient Joint&quot; from the menu.
