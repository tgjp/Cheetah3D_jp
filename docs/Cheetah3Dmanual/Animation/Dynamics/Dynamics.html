Hereby Cheetah3D relies                on the industry proven <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/">Bullet                  Physics</a> engine which was already used for many Hollywood                block busters.</p>              <p>To create a physical simulation you first have to tell                Cheetah3D which objects of your scene should be part of the                dynamics simulation. Therefore you have to assign the                appropriate dynamics tags to these objects. For creating a rigid                body assign a <a href="../../Tags/RigidBodyTag/RigidBodyTag.html">Rigid                  body</a> tag, for creating a soft body assign a <a href="../../Tags/SoftBodyTag/SoftBodyTag.html">Soft                  Body </a>Tag and for creating a rope assign a <a href="../../Tags/RopeTag/RopeTag.html">Rope</a>                Tag. If you want to attach a rigid body to a soft body you can                use the <a href="../../Tags/AnchorTag/AnchorTag.html">Anchor</a>                tag.</p>            </div>            <div align="center">              <p><img src="Dynamics2.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>                Simple scene with some dynamic objects</p>            </div>            <div align="left">              <p>Once you've assigned the proper tags to the objects you can set                the physical properties of the objects (like the mass, friction,                stiffness, etc.) in their dynamics tags.</p>            </div>            <div align="center">              <p><img src="Dynamics3.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>            </div>            <div align="left">              <p>Now you are already done. Click on the Play animation button in                the Timeline to view the simulation results in real-time. </p>              <p></p>              <p><b>Initial Sate</b></p>              <p>Every physical simulation needs an initial state. This is the                state (position, rotation, speed, etc.) of all objects, soft                body control points or particles at time T=0. In Cheetah3D every                physical simulation starts at time T=0. When you run the                simulation for the first time Cheetah3D automatically saves the                initial state of all objects at that time. Once the animation                return back to T=0 the initial state is recovered. The initial                state of a object can be only manipulated at time T=0. So once                you've attached dynamics tags to objects only transform them at                time T=0 otherwise the initial position of the object gets                recovered once the time changes to T=0 later. </p>              <p></p>              <p><b>Simulation complexity</b></p>              <p>If the simulation isn't too complex you can view the dynamics                simulation in real-time by simply playing the animation. But                should the simulation become too complex to play it in real-time                anymore (30 frames per second) then it is recommended to turn on                the "Frame by Frame" playback mode. It guarantees that every                frame is simulated and that Cheetah3D doesn't drop frames to                stay realtime. You can turn on the "Frame by Frame" mode with                the "Animation -&gt; Frames per Second" menu command. This mode                also improves the simulation accuracy so it is never a bad idea                to turn it on when dealing with dynamics.</p>              <ul>              </ul>            </div>            <div align="center">              <p><img src="Dynamics4.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>            </div>            <div align="left">              <p>Once you use big particle systems or soft bodies in your                simulation even the "Frame by Frame" mode might become to slow.                Then it is time to start baking your simulation. During baking                the simulation results are kept in a cache which is then used to                play back the simulation. With the baking feature even particle                systems with thousand of rigid bodies can be handled. But be                aware that the dynamics cache is saved to your .jas file. So                .jas file size can increase considerably.</p>              <p></p>              <div align="left">                <p><b>Tips</b></p>                <ul>                  <li>Only assign Dynamics tags to those objects which really                    have an influence on your simulation.
