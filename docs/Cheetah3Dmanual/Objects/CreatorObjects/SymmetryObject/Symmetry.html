They have two eyes, an equal number of legs, two arms, two wings and so on. With the help of the symmetry object you only have to model one side of the creature (assuming you're trying to model something real!). The second side will be automatically created through mirroring the geometry. See the image below for an example. Only one eye, wing, foot and so on was modelled. The counterpart was created through the symmetry object, saving considerable effort.</p>					</div>					<div align="center">						<p><img src="Symmetry1.jpg" alt="" align="middle" border="0">   <img src="Symmetry2.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="326" align="middle" border="0"></p>					</div>					<div align="left"></div>					<p><b><i>Usage</i></b><br>To use the symmetry object, just drag and drop a polygon object into a symmetry object (as in the examples above).</p>					<p><b>Properties</b></p>					<ul>						<li><i><b>Attraction radius:</b></i> Determines how close a point has to get to the symmetry plane until it won't be mirrored. Points within the attraction radius will be used as weld points to the mirrored geometry.					<li><i><b>Symmetry plane:</b></i> Controls on what plane the geometry will be mirrored.						<li><b><i>Symmetrical: </i></b>Determines if  the points which are in the radius of attraction are snapped to the <b>symmetry plane</b> or not.						<li><b><i>Weld points: </i></b>Determine is the geometry should be welded together at the points which are in the <b>attraction radius</b>.					</ul>					<p></p>					<div align="left">						<p><b></b></p>					</div>				</td>			</tr>		</table>
