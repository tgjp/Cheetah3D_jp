Most creatures have two eyes, an equal number of legs, two arms, two wings and so on. With the help of the symmetry modifier you only have to model one side of the creature (assuming you're trying to model something real!). The second side will be automatically created through mirroring the geometry. See the image below for an example. Only one eye, wing, foot and so on was modelled. The counterpart was created through the symmetry modifier, saving considerable effort.</p>						</div>						<div align="center">							<p><img src="../../CreatorObjects/SymmetryObject/Symmetry2.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="326" align="middle" border="0"></p>						</div>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p><b>Properties</b></p>						<ul>							<li><i><b>Attraction radius:</b></i> Determines how close a point has to get to the symmetry plane until it won't be mirrored.
