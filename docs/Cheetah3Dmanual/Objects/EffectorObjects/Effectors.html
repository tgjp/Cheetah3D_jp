						<p>Effector objects are split into two groups:<br>
						<ul>
						<li><b>Dynamic effectors:</b> which effect the dynamics of a particle. These are the forces.
						<li><b>State effectors:</b> They have no influence on the dynamics. They just change the state of a particle and are performed after the dynamics so are comparable to how modifier objects work on polygon objects. They are non-destructive. At the moment there is just one state effector, the Orientation effector.
						</ul>
						Effector objects are used together with particle objects to achieve a greater sense of realism and add an additional level of complexity. Dynamic Force effector objects try to mimic natural behavior and can add a level of realism to a scene which includes particles. State effector objects allow you to pass transformation information to particles.
	  </p><div align="center" >
			  </div>
					<div align="left" >
						<p>You can have numerous forces in a scene to influence particles and use them to affect individual or scene wide particle objects because effectors only work in a certain range the effectiveness of an effector can be limited so that it doesn't work globally. This open up the possibility for closer relationships between effectors and particle emitters.</p>
