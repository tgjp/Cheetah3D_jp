Since it is a parametric polygonobject, it is possible to change the properties of the relief object and see how those changes affect the surface.</p>						<p>The relief object is very good at producing instant landscapes, which you may find useful if you're developing a computer game, or need to render an outdoor scene.</p>					</div>					<div align="center">						<p><img src="Relief1.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="331" border="0"></p>					</div>					<p>Using the properties of the relief object, it is possible to achieve some very complex and detailed results, since the relief provides built-in random texturing and contouring routines. The image below was generated using a single relief for the landscape, and a single plain for the water. A light was added for the sun, and the sky was a very large sphere. Final touches such as the lens flare and sky haze were added using Photoshop after.</p>					<div align="center">						<p><img src="Relief2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="422" border="0"></p>					</div>					<p></p>					<p><b>Properties</b></p>					<ul>						<li><b><i>Sections Width: </i></b>Specifies the number of sections the width of the relief will be made up of. Defaults to 100. The higher this figure, the more detailed the relief will be.				<li><b><i>Sections Depth: </i></b>Specifies the number of sections the depth of the relief will be made up of. Defaults to 100. The higher this figure, the more detailed the relief will be.<br>							<i>Note that the above two properties determine how many individual 'squares' make up the entire relief. By default, 100x100 = 10000 polygons. Bear in mind that increasing these figures exponentially increases the amount of  CPU time any 3D scene will take to render or edit.</i>																							<li><b><i>Width X: </i></b>The width of the plain.					<li><b><i>Height Y: </i></b>The maximum height of the plain's highest peak.						<li><b><i>Depth Z: </i></b>The depth of the plain.						<li><i><b>Noise: </b></i>Determines how 'noisy' the surface of the relief will be by mixing in an low-pass (smoothed) source of randomness.						<li><b><i>Turbulence: </i></b>Determines how 'turbulent' the surface of the relief will be my mixing in an unsmoothed source of randomness.						<li><b><i>Texture intensity: </i></b>Determines how much of the texture map will be mixed into the surface of the relief (allowing you to provide your own source of noise - see <i>texture</i> below)						<li><b><i>Sea level: </i></b>Determines how high the sea will be (ie, the level at which the bottom of the relief stops and goes flat)						<li><b><i>Plateau level: </i></b>Determines how high the plateaus will be (ie, the level at which the top of the relief levels out)						<li><b><i>Edge at sea level: </i></b>If ticked, the relief will not descend to sea-level at the edges. If you do not need a coast-line, you would probably turn this off.						<li><b><i>Texture: </i></b>Use this to specify a texture bitmap to use (see <i>texture intensity</i> above)					</ul>				</td>			</tr>		</table>
