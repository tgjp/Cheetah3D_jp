						<p>So, you're new to 3D modelling and want to learn how to get started. You'll be glad you tried Cheetah3D, since you'll soon see how easy it is to pick up, and when you've gained more confidence, you'll realise that Cheetah3D is powerful enough to keep serving you. To get started, click on each linked phrase to find out more, and then use your browser's Back button to return back here to carry on. If you come across a word or term you're not sure about, check out the <a href="../Glossary/Glossary.html">Glossary of Terms</a>, which describes common words as simply as possible.</p>
						<p>First of all, you should familiarise yourself with Cheetah3D's main window, which contains the <a href="../3dView/3dView.html">3D View</a> (where you'll see a basic version of the 3D scene you're creating).</p>
						<p>The objects you see in the 3D View are also represented in a hierarchical list, known as the <a href="../ObjectBrowser/ObjectBrowser.html">Object Browser</a>, which is in the lower-right corner of the main window. This list is used to arrange the objects logically (rather than physically, as the 3D View does), select objects for editing, and to control the additional data associated with each object (known as <a href="../ObjectsAndTags/ObjectsAndTags.html">Tags</a>).</p>
						<p>You'll notice that when you select an object in the Object Browser, the <a href="../PropertyEditor/PropertyEditor.html">Property Editor</a> (at the top right of the window) changes to tell you all the details you can modify. Making changes in the Property Editor results in realtime changes in the 3D View, which is a great way of trying things out. The lower portion of the Property Editor changes depending upon which tool is currently active.</p>
						<p>The Toolbar at the top of the window gives you access to the <a href="../../Tools/Common/SelectTool/SelectTool.html">Select Tool</a>, the <a href="../../Tools/Common/TransformTool/TransformTool.html">Transform Tool</a> (and the X, Y and Z transform lock icons), the <a href="../Modes/Modes.html">four Mode buttons</a>, and a range of drop-down menus that give you easy to use objects, and a cheetah head button that renders your 3D scene! On the far right of the toolbar, you'll find the Materials button, which you can use to create materials that you can then assign to objects in your scene.</p>
						<p>You should now know enough about Cheetah3D to be able to try the <a href="../../Tutorials/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.html">Hello World tutorial</a>, in which you'll create your very own world! (Don't panic, it's easier than it sounds).</p>
						<p>When you're comfortable with the things you've tried so far, you can go on to learn how to effectively use the different Modes. The <a href="../../Tutorials/Axe/Axe.html">second tutorial</a>, in which you'll make a model of an axe, will guide you through the process of editing a box in polygon mode (where you transform individual surfaces of an object), using some of the advanced modelling tools, as well as introducing you to the powerful technique of subdivision modelling.</p>
						<p>Now that you're comfortable enough to explore the rest of the tools and features available to you, you may also want to read the <a href="../Hints/HintsAndTips.html">Hints and Tips</a> that will make your use of Cheetah3D that much easier.</p>
						<p>Happy modelling!</p>
