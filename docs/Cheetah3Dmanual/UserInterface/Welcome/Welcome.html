Hopefully you'll find it easy enough to use and learn (the extensive documentation will guide you through the process even if you're new to 3D modelling), simple and uncluttered enough not to be annoying, quick and efficient enough to be a pleasure to use, and powerful enough to impress you!</p>						<p>Many 3D modellers and renderers are not only highly-priced, but they're also difficult to learn. That's because the makers of those pieces of software want people to think that using such software is complex and only for the people who can afford to hefty price tag. What Cheetah3D attempts to do is bring powerful and easy 3D modelling and rendering capabilities to everyone.</p>						<p>Even better, Cheetah3D has been written from the ground up for Mac OS X using Cocoa. Its not just a simple recompile of some user-unfriendly X11 modeller which ends up looking, feeling and behaving like a not-very-Macintosh piece of software. Cheetah3D uses all the Mac OS X components we're all familiar with so you'll feel right at home using it.</p>						<p><b>Now what?<br>							</b>If you're new to 3D modelling and want to learn some basics, take a look at the <a href="../BeginnersGuide/BeginnersGuide.html">beginner's guide</a>. This will tell you which are the most important things to learn about first, and will then guide you onto some simple tutorials to get you started.</p>						<p>If you're familiar with 3D modelling and would like to find out how to do the things you're used to, take a look at the <a href="../../index.html">index</a> to see the range of powerful tools you have available to you. Hopefully you'll find that Cheetah3D is more than capable.</p>						<p>If you're a seasoned 3D modelling veteran, and need to see some of the really impressive stuff you can create with Cheetah3D, take a look at the <a href="../../Render/Renderer.html">Renderer</a> specification (you'll see that despite its ease of use, Cheetah3D can produce some really stunning images). If you've got a live internet connection, you could even take a look at the <a href="http://cheetah3d.com/gallery.php" target="c3dpop">online gallery</a> of images that have been made using Cheetah3D.</p>					</div>					<div align="center">						<p></p>					</div>				</td>			</tr>		</table>
