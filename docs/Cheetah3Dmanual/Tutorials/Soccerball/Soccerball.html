						<p>In this tutorial we're going to make a classic soccer ball. This is actually quite simple and will only take a few minutes, despite it's apparent complexity.</p>

									We kick off by making a <a href="../../Objects/PolygonObjects/Polyhedra/Polyhedra.html">polyhedra</a> object. We can use the standard settings of a truncated Icosahedron. Now make the <a href="../../Objects/PolygonObjects/Polyhedra/Polyhedra.html">polyhedra</a> object <a href="../../Objects/PolygonObjects/Polygonobject.html">editable</a> so that we can modify with our ball on the polygon level. Your scene should look like this.</td>

								<td valign="center" width="320"><b>2.</b> <b>Making the color selections</b><br>
									Now we have to colorize the different fields of our ball. Polygons with 5 corners (pentagons) will become black. Polygons with 6 corners (hexagons) will become white.

									<p>First create two materials, a black one and a white one. Then select all the pentagons (first image). Now drag and drop the black material onto the polygon selection. All selected polygons are black now (second image).</p>
									<p>Repeat the same steps with the hexagons and the white material.</p>

								<td valign="center" width="320"><b>3. Making it a perfect sphere</b><br>
									
									To make a perfect sphere we first have to increase the tessellation of our angular ball. This can be done by attaching a <a href="../../Objects/ModifierObjects/SubDiv/SubDiv.html">Subdivision</a> modifier. Note that the modifier object goes &quot;inside&quot; the Polyhedra object in the object view - this differs to how <a href="../../Objects/CreatorObjects/CreatorObjects.html">Creator objects</a> work. Now the ball looks much better but it is not quite a perfect sphere. Attaching a <a href="../../Objects/ModifierObjects/Spherify/Spherify.html">Spherify</a> modifier finally makes a real ball.</td>

								<td valign="center" width="320"><b>4. Adding seams</b><br>
									
									Now it is time to make the seams. This is the most awkward part of the tutorial, but don't worry! If you've defined the <a href="../../Tools/Polygon/ExtrudeTool/ExtrudeTool.html">extrude</a> and the <a href="../../Tools/Common/SelectTool/SelectTool.html">select</a> tool to a hot key this job can be done in minutes.
									<p>First make your ball <a href="../../Objects/PolygonObjects/Polygonobject.html">editable</a> again. Then select each field (segment of material) of the soccer ball and extrude it a little bit. It is enough to simply click in the 3D view because the extrude tool moves the polygon selection automatically a small distance when you click. This small distance is enough for our soccer ball. You might also want to work with the &quot;quantize&quot; property of the extrude tool for a more accurate extrude.</p>

								<td valign="center" width="320"><b>5. Finishing the soccer ball</b><br>
									
									After extruding every field of the soccer ball you should end up with something like this. It still doesn't look quite like a real soccer ball though.
									<p>You might already expect the finishing touch. To finish your ball you just have to attach a subdivision modifier to the polygon object. Now all edges will be smoothed out. And here it is, your first self made soccer ball.</p>
									<p>Game over!</p>

										<b>Now it is your turn. Using the same technique, you can produce many types of balls. To create a volleyball for example you would start with a box instead of the truncated icosahedron.</b></div>
