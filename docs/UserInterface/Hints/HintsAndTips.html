          <h2>Hints and Tips</h2>
        </div>

        <div align="left">
          <p>Here we'll give you some quick hints and tips which will make your use of Cheetah3D quicker, more efficient and easier.</p>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <div align="left">
              <ul>
                <li><b>Use the hotkeys</b><br>
                Take some time to define suitable hotkeys for your most commonly used actions. This will make your use of Cheetah3D much quicker since you'll be using the keyboard a lot. This will reduce the amount of time you'll spend looking through the menus, and means less moving the mouse around, too.</li>

                <li><b>Use the modifier keys for moving the camera<br></b> When you hold down the Alt, Command and Shift keys whilst clicking and dragging in the 3D view, you can move the camera around. This is often quicker than using the camera movement icons below the toolbar.</li>

                <li><b>Name everything!<br></b> Take some time to change the name of every object in your scene to something logical. This will help you keep track of what you need to edit.</li>

                <li><b>Use folders<br></b> Put objects that are related into a folder to simplify arrangements. Folders are also useful for making groups of objects stay together when you transform them. You can make complex sub coordinate systems by nesting folders of objects inside other folders of objects, too.</li>

                <li><b>Making items editable<br></b> Double-click on the object icon in the Object Browser to make objects editable. You can also use the Alt-Cmd-C key combination.</li>

                <li><b>Use multiple cameras<br></b> If the position of a camera is important in the composition of a scene, use a second camera to help you position objects. You can switch between cameras quickly by double-clicking on the desired camera's icon in the Object Browser. The currently active camera has a light blue background.</li>

                <li><b>File formats</b><br>
                To save your render in a format other than TIFF, just type the extension after your filename when you specify where to save the file (for example, "My Amazing Scene.jpg"). Most common formats are supported: JPG, TIFF, PNG, and even the Mac OS X Icon .icns format!</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div align="left">
          <p>When you've mastered Cheetah3D's controls and tools, you'll may be interested in making more realistic or aesthetic scenes. Here are a few general tips that might help you make more pleasing renders.</p>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            <div align="left">
              <ul>
                <li><b>Lighting<br></b> A scene will be set alive by proper use of lighting. It's easy to forget about your light sources, or to add them in last thing and not pay much attention to them. Think about how the lights would be positioned, if they'd be highly directional, and the other characteristics of the light sources, such as their attenuation (realistic light <u>always attenuates</u>!). Also, use more than one light. Cheetah3D can render up to 1024 light sources (although OpenGL cannot), so don't be afraid to be precise.</li>

                <li><b>Shadows<br></b> Again, shadows are an integral part of nature. As humans, we instinctively want to live in the shade - it reminds us of shelter. Unless you want that "bright studio look", shadows must be used and considered carefully. What you <i>don't</i> see is as important as what you do.<br>
                <i>PS. Even the "bright studio look" relies on shadows to visually balance a scene.</i></li>

                <li><b>Reflections (the optic kind)<br></b> A lot of surfaces in reality reflect, even if it's imperceptible. Don't over-do it though, since Cheetah3D cannot simulate complex diffusive reflections without intensive use of bump mapping. Careful use of the reflection properties will give you a lot of realism.</li>

                <li><b>Reflections (the mental kind)<br></b> If you're modelling a real object, take a good long look at the actual thing (from all sides, including underneath if you can!) and spend time getting used to it. Understand what the details, imperfections and perfections are. Ask yourself "what colours am I actually seeing?" (regardless of what colour the object is supposed to be). Why would they be different? What colour is the light that is shining on it? It's unlikely to be pure white!</li>

                <li><b>Less is more<br></b> Often, a scene doesn't need to be physically full in order to be pleasing. Instead of trying to model every last detail (which will drive you insane!), concentrate on the important parts, and make them detailed. Subtlety will also help, since it is the liminal ("barely visible") variations that we hardly notice that will make us appreciate something subconsciously. Use texture and bump maps to introduce slight variations (not bold statements).</li>

                <li><b>Pick up a real camera<br></b> You might learn a lot from Photography tutorials, since photographers treat their work as an artform rather than a science. Considerations such as composition, psychological focus and avoiding visual distractions are important and good photographers understand these before they even get their camera out. Even though you're simulating a scene instead of capturing one, finding out what makes a good photograph will help you produce stunning results. Cheetah3D gives you a lot of power that even professional photographers don't have: A very widely flexible field of view, an infinitely positionable camera, a multitude of lights that can be put anywhere - Photographers would love to have this power over their expensive equipment!

          Most importantly, however - have fun. Creating 3D scenes can be very rewarding - Happy rendering!<br>
